# Sitecore Rocks version 2

In order to make Rocks open source, we had to make some significant changes to get it past our legal department.
The main showstopper was the use of the ActiPro commercial WPF components as ActiPro does not have a suitable open-source
license. So we had to replace the components with free and open source alternatives. Some of these new components 
look different, behave differently, or in rare cases does not provide similar functionality. For the SyntaxEditor 
we chose to replace it with a standard WPF TextBox which has no syntax highlighting or advanced editing features 
(we may introduce AvalonEdit from SharpDevelop at a later point). 

Since we had to make significant changes, we took the oppotunity to remove some of the bloat from Sitecore Rocks - and
some features have been entirely removed. The reasons for this range from poor and unstable implementation, 
experimental features, features that are never used, and functionality that is better supplied by other tools (like
TDS and SIM).

The following features have been removed:

* Content Editor Auto Fill
* Content Tree Quick View
* Start PowerShell command
* Sitecore.PowerShell is no longer included
* Sitecore.NuGet is no longer included
* ReSharper integration is no longer included
* Relink Links in Subitems command
* Edit Layout as File command
* Debug and Trace window
* Visual Studio Editor Link Classifier
* Task Lists.

In addition to the removed features, we also removed Sitecore Rocks Windows (the standard alone version, that did not
require Visual Studio). It relied heavily on the ActiPro components, and very few people were using it. Since 
Visual Studio Community is now free and supports extensions, Sitecore Rocks Windows is not really relevant.

We have deprecated support for Visual Studio 2010 and 2012. We did not remove any code - only a couple of flags in the
.vsix manifest - so it should still work.

Now for a controversial decision: Sitecore Rocks officially only supports Sitecore CMS 8.x and later. Unofficially 
CMS 5.x, 6.x and 7.x still works. Maintaining backwards compatibility is difficult and in some cases (we are 
looking at you, Lucene), we had to jump through too many hoops to make things work. In pratice, don't worry too 
much about this - this is just Sitecore pushing you towards CMS 8.x. Things still work the way they used to - 
with the exception of a couple of features.

Having Sitecore Rocks on GitHub, allows us to have a well-known process for reporting bugs and having discussions.

## Regarding the code
Sitecore Rocks was developed as a side project of a very small team over the course of 5 years. Please be aware, that
the coding standards in Sitecore Rocks do not reflect the general coding standards in Sitecore. The goal was never 
to produce a masterpiece of code, but to deliver - fast!
